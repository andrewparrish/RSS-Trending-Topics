## App Structure

* app.js -- Main entrypoint to run express server. Accepts request to provided routing and offloads processing to handlers
* Handlers -- Route handling. For this project, only one handler, TrendingHandler.
* Services -- RSS requests, processing of that data, and extracting of trends from said data.

Tests are contained in the test/ folder and can be run with:

Test data from RSS feeds in stored in test/test_data for mocking.
